# Book Notes
This repository is for me to keep notes about a book that I intend to write. For example, I describe the following:
- major characters,
  - Their names
  - Character traits
- the magic,
- political,
- economic,
- religious, and
- social systems

in the world.

## Sections
There is a folder called [Notes](./notes), which has the individual markdown files explaining most of the above.

There is also a folder called [Book](./book), which contains the book's `.tex` file. The book is to be written in $\LaTeX$ using the *book* style.

Finally, this root directory contains this [README.md](.) as well as the aforementioned folders.
