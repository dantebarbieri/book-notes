# Magic
This Markdown File describes the Magic System in the World.
## Summary

## Who
Only certain people can use magic. All of these people are nobles because most magic wielders come from the noble class, and peasants who show magical gifts are often given land of their own and join the noble class.

Because all magic wielders become nobles, the term for one who does magic is often simply "noble." Sometimes, another name, "mage," is used. "Mage" is never plural because it has never happened that two non-noble mages have existed simultaneously.

## What

## When
The first recorded king of man, "Swain," united people with his magical powers. He traversed the simple farming settlements that dotted the landscape and convinced the farmers to follow him. Not long after establishing a kingdom, descendants of Swain began to show magical powers themselves.

Rarely, a person not descended from Swain was capable of magical powers. Rarer still was a random magic user's talents more extraordinary than those of the descendants of Swain, but it happened from time to time.

## Where
Most magic users come from the existing nobility, which is descended mainly from Swain and his followers. Other members of the nobility come from random magic users, but these tend not to be consistently strong families (don't produce many more magic users and gradually lose power).

Approximately 1 in 10,000 people can use some magic. Of these, the breakdown is 95% can only use low-level magic, 5% can use mid-level magic. More potent magic and the strongest magics are so rare that generally, only the king will have that kind of power.

## Why
Most magic users "feel" the magic as they use it, but the mechanics relate to the World. The mechanics of the process connect to magical webs that traverse the land, and one's affinity to these strands determines the power of magic that one can use. Detecting the lines can be rarely done. It is only possible if one's senses are severely augmented. However, this has not shown to lead to an increase in power in most cases. In locations where there are more magical intersections, mages can use more control before becoming tired.
